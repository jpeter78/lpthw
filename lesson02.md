## 习题2：注释和\#号
程序里的注释是很重要的。它们可以用自然语言告诉你某段代码的功能是什么。在你想要临时移除一段代码时，你还可以用注解的方式将这段代码临时禁用。接下来的练习将让你学会注释：
```
# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.

# Anything after the # is ignored by python.

print("I could have code like this.") # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# print("This won't run.")

print("This will run.")
```
